## Antenna

Based on [Your Own Channel](https://github.com/kane2931/ownchannel), Antenna is a collection of side-loading tvOS apps for playing (the free and publicly available but geo-blocked) Australian commercial television streams on your Apple TV 4. The project is lacking any type of advanced user interface or EPG.

Set your location inside the **ViewController.swift** file to view regional streams. As per the usual side-loading procedure, you will need to change the Bundle Identifier, however not just once but for each app target.

All artwork (and initial testing) kindly provided by Steeley.

Created as a learning project, please support the official apps when they become available.
